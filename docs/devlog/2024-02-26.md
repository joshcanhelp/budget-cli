I starting working on the auto-categorization and I knew I wanted to be able to see the auto-categorized transaction before saving it. So I worked on the transaction printing and added that as a confirm prompt if it's able to categorize. This worked pretty well as a solution to the editing problem. Now, after the transaction is complete, you have to confirm to save it. That's helped me a few times already walking through the imports for the year. 

I got hung up on Jest testing as I was making this change. I realized that a lot of the Jest and TypeScript combination is a mystery, I just try different options until it works. I'd like to put together a TS + Node + Jest starter repo with everything all wired up so I can re-use it and *actually* understand how all of these flags are working together. It was a function of `moduleNameMapper` ([StackOverflow answer]([https://stackoverflow.com/a/69598249](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69598249))) changing the `*.js` import to remove the file extension. Why does it work in TS but not Jest? Who knows! ðŸª„

During my troubleshooting and testing today I tried out [csvlens](https://github.com/YS-L/csvlens) and it worked really well for navigating the CSV data output.
