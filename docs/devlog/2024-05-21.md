I poked around with Plaid last week and was disappointed to figure out that there is no clear way to do authorization via CLI, everything has to run through their front-end SDK. That should work fine but I'll need to sit down and spend some time with it, time I don't really have to spare at the moment. 

I've let budgeting fall behind for 3 months and now going back to handle it all. It really is such a chore to do all of this exporting and categorization.
