I've been thinking about what's irritating about budgeting and how this tool could help more, besides a list of features.

- I'm missing a way to get a better analysis of what's going on. It always feels like the window is too small or I'm taking into account the wrong stuff to get a better idea of what's happening. I can't tell if I need more granular controls and views or if I'm just overanalyzing.
- I definitely need a better way to view and manage transactions. I'm still opening up Numbers to work with the CSV and I want to move away from that.
- Downloading and managing files is a pain but now that the CLI can read from a default directory and move the files, that feels better.
