I took a break from this project in order to work on [my other CLI project](https://github.com/PersonalDataPipeline/data-getter). I've been looking for a CLI framework to handle the details around arguments, flags, and distribution and found what I needed in [oclif](https://oclif.io). I'm wary about adding new non-dev dependencies but this is well-maintained by a motivated company (SalesForce) and addresses a bunch of black box things around CLIs that I just don't want to deal with. It's also structured in a way that makes it easy to keep "business" logic pretty well separated from the CLI framework.
