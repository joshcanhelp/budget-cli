## [[2024-02-23]]

This tool has been very useful for me for the last year. The satisfaction of building your own tool combined with the ability to make the tool exactly what you need have both combined to make this feel like a resounding success so far. That said, there is plenty of room for improvement here. 

Today, I'm importing 2 months worth of transactions and working through our taxes for 2023. I'm going to take notes here while I do that, focusing on making small improvements along the way and taking notes about larger ones. 

First things first: collecting all the necessary CSVs.
