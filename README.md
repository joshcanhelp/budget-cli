# Budget CLI

This little command line tool is the culmination of many years of frustration managing our family's budget. It's main purpose is to import transaction CSVs from our various banks, de-dupe, and categorize them. With a database of transactions, it can provide a YTD report of how much you have spent in what categories and an output of transactions in specific buckets. In the spirit of [Plain Text Accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org), it uses a local CSV as a database, making it easy to adjust things manually, if needed. 

## Getting Started

This tool is written in TypeScript and targets Node 16 and above but it may work in earlier versions. You will need to have Node and `npm` installed (I recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for this) before following the steps below.

Clone this repo and install dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:joshcanhelp/budget-cli.git
$ npm install
```

Build the TS files:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

The script defaults to `./output/data.csv` for it's database so, to test it out, create that file and try to run a report:

```bash
$ mkdir output
$ touch output.csv
```

You should see the following output:

```
ü§ñ Reading from ./output/data.csv
‚ùå No transactions found for this date.
```

You are now (probably) ready to go!

## Configuration

This tool can be configured using a `.budget-cli.json` file in the root of this project. This file is ignored by git so you can keep your local configuration and still make contributions, should you be so kind. An exmample file is below:

```json
{
  "outputFile": {
    "YYYY": "/absolute/path/to/data.csv"
  },
  "subCategories": {
    "income": [
      "income_subcategory_1",
      "income_subcategory_2",
      "income_subcategory_3"
    ],
    "expense": [
      "expense_subcategory_1",
      "expense_subcategory_2",
      "expense_subcategory_3"
    ]
  },
  "expenseAllowance": {
    "YYYY": {
      "expense_subcategory_1": {
        "allowance": 300,
        "carryover": 0
      },
      "expense_subcategory_2": {
        "allowance": 300,
        "carryover": 125
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All keys are optional and will provide defaults. 

- `outputFile`: This can be set to a string to use a single file for all transactions or an object with years as keys and paths as values to set a different file for different years. 
- `subCategories`: This can be set to an object with `income` and `expense` as keys. Each of those keys must be set to an array of strings indicating the sub-categories to use for each. When importing transactions, the tool will prompt you to select one. 
- `expenseAllowance`: This can be set to an object with keys indicating a specific year. Each year should be set to an object with expense sub-categories as keys. Each sub-category should be set to an object with the keys `allowance`, indicating how much is allowed per month, and `carryover`, indicating any rollover from the previous year (or `0` if none).

## Importing Transactions

The first thing you will need for this to do anything for you are some transactions in the database. Transactions are imported from CSV files and translated from their original format to the CSV database. The translators currently available are the [translators](src/translators) folder. See the [Contributing](#Contributing) section for how to add or request new translators. 

Assuming we have a CSV from one of the supported banks, we can run the importer, indicating a specific file or a directory containing one or more CSV files. 

```bash
$ npm run import -- --input='/path/to/directory'
# ... or
$ npm run import -- --input='/path/to/directory/transactions.csv'
```

By default, the script will only import transactions for the current year. To import from a year in the past (or, I guess, the future), add a `year` argument to the command.

```bash
$ npm run import -- --input='/path/to/directory' --year='2022'
```
