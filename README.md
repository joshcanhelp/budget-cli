# Budget CLI

This little command line tool is the culmination of many years of frustration managing our family's budget. It's main purpose is to import transaction CSVs from our various banks, de-dupe, and categorize them. With a database of transactions, it can provide a YTD report of how much you have spent in what categories and an output of transactions in specific buckets. It uses a local CSV as a database, making it easy to adjust things manually, if needed.

**Please note:** I use this weekly to manage our money so I try to keep it bug-free. That said, this is currently an unversioned, often-changing project. For that reason, make sure to check imported transactions after updates and [let me know](/joshcanhelp/budget-cli/issues/new) if you find any problems.
